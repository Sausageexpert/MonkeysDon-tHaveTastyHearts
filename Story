Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived in a tree that bore juicy red apples. He was very happy.
One day, a crocodile swam up to that tree and told the monkey that he had travelled a long distance
and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few apples.The crocodile
enjoyed them very much and thanked the monkey, asking him (the monkey) if he could come again for some 
more fruit! The generous monkey happily agreed. The crocodile returned the next day, and the next, and
the one after that too! Soon, the monkey and the crocodile became good friends! They discussed their lives,
their friends and family, like how good friends do
