Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived in a tree that bore juicy red apples. He was very happy.
One day, a crocodile swam up to that tree and told the monkey that he had travelled a long distance
and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few apples.The crocodile
enjoyed them very much and thanked the monkey, asking him (the monkey) if he could come again for some 
more fruit! The generous monkey happily agreed. The crocodile returned the next day, and the next, and
the one after that too! Soon, the monkey and the crocodile became good friends! They discussed their lives,
their friends and family, like how good friends do. Soon, the crocodile told his perfectly 'innocent' wife
about his new friend, the monkey! However, the crocodile's wife (I'll just call her 'croc'), did NOT approve
of her husband gallivanting with jungle folk, and thought that the monkey would lead him astray onto some
diabolical scheme to take over the world. Of course, the crocodile (I'll call him 'Jeff' for short) did not
listen to croc, and went ahead and gallivanted with the monkey. (Exciting Drumroll for suspense) 

Narrator: "And here's the interval, folks!"

Of course, we all know what happens when husbands don't listen to their wives, and sure enough, the monkey
wasn't as furry, cute and innocent as he would have everyone believe. The crocodile's wife made vain efforts
to stop Jeff from visiting the monkey (by trying to persuade him to eat the monkey), but Jeff was horrified at that
"I'm a vegetarian!", he said, "and so should all crocodiles be!"
"Oh well", said croc,
